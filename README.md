# Movie-Recommendation-System
The system uses a content-based filtering approach to recommend movies similar to a user's favorite movie. It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and cosine similarity to compute the similarity between movies based on their features such as genres, keywords, tagline, cast, and director.
